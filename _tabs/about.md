My name is Frédéric ADAM, I currently work as a Security Expert.

My experience includes  : 
* 4 years as Web2 pentester, focused primarily in Web
* 1 year as Web3 auditor, auditing Solidity mostly.
* 1 year as Security engineer, worked on Firewall, DNS, Reverse-Proxy…
* 2 years as Web Infrastructure/Security engineer, worked on CDN, DNS, Web servers, CI/CD…

## Interests
In my spare time, I research vulnerabilities on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com) in the domains detailed below.
* **Web2 impacting Web3** : Web2 remains the entry door to the Web3 world for most users. This field is critical and underestimated by most projects.
* **Bridges**: Bridges hold huge amounts of money. They also require Web2 infrastructure (servers, network communication) and Web3 (smart contracts). This unique combination creates more possibilities for an attacker, and I believe more vulnerabilities are to be discovered in this area.
* **Blockchain infrastructure** : Finding vulnerabilities within the services exposed by the Blockchain software, that can cause damage to the entire blockchain. For instance, being able to DoS an Ethereum node with GraphQL.
